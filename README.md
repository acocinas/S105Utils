# 📌 Java File Management Exercises

## 📜 Description
The exercises  must be executed from the command line, not just from the IDE. Create a file named `readme.txt` to document the commands needed to execute each exercise. These commands should compile Java source files (`.java`) into Java bytecode (`.class`) and then execute them.

### 🔹 General Guidelines:
- For this project **IntelliJ** has been used.
- This project is a **Java projects** without other build system like Maven or Gradle.
- The programming language used is **Java**(Jbr-17 version)

🚀 **Let's get started!**

## 📝 Level 1

### 📌 Exercise 1
- Create a class that lists the contents of a directory **alphabetically**, receiving the directory path as a parameter.

### 📌 Exercise 2
- Enhance the previous class by adding the functionality to **list a directory tree recursively**.
- Display all contents in **alphabetical order** within each level.
- Indicate whether each item is a **directory (D)** or a **file (F)**.
- Show the **last modified date** of each item.

### 📌 Exercise 3
- Modify the previous exercise so that instead of displaying the results on the screen, the output is saved in a **TXT file**.

### 📌 Exercise 4
- Add functionality to read any **TXT file** and display its contents in the console.

### 📌 Exercise 5
- The program should now **serialize** a Java object into a `.ser` file and then **deserialize** it back.
